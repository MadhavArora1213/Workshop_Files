2. **Responsive Design**: The `lg:w-1/2` class ensures that each side (left and right) takes 50% of the width on large screens, but the elements stack vertically on smaller screens with `w-full`.
3. **Custom Background Color**: The `bg-[#527385]` sets a custom background color to a blue-gray shade.
4. **Padding and Sizing**: The `p-4` class provides consistent padding around both the left and right sections. The `h-auto` and `w-full` classes ensure the components take up the full available width and adjust their height dynamically based on the content.

This layout is designed to be responsive and adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind's utility classes. The custom background color enhances the visual appeal of the component.

# `index.css`

```markdown
# Index.css Documentation

This file contains the core styles for the project, including Tailwind CSS imports, custom styles, and specific component styling. Below is a breakdown of the content within this file.

## 1. Tailwind CSS Imports

The following lines import Tailwind CSS and required styles from the Keep React library:

```css
@import "keep-react/css"; /* Imports the CSS styles from the Keep React library, which provides UI components */
@tailwind base;           /* Applies Tailwind's base styles for consistent default styling across all browsers */
@tailwind components;     /* Adds pre-built component styles from Tailwind CSS for efficient UI development */
@tailwind utilities;      /* Imports utility classes for easy direct styling of elements */
```

## 2. Custom Shadow Class

The following class creates a custom shadow effect that can be applied to various elements:

```css
.customshadow {
    box-shadow: -13px 12px 15px 8px black; /* Custom shadow definition */
}
```

### Explanation

- **X offset**: `-13px` (shadow moves to the left).
- **Y offset**: `12px` (shadow moves down).
- **Blur radius**: `15px` (softening effect).
- **Spread radius**: `8px` (increases the size of the shadow).
- **Color**: `black`.

## 3. Hexagonal Layout Styles

The following class styles elements to take on a hexagonal shape:

```css
.hexagon {
    width: 100%; /* Fills the width of the parent container */
    height: 100%; /* Fills the height of the parent container */
    position: relative; /* Allows positioning of child elements within the hexagon */
    clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 25%, 100% 75%, 50% 100%, 0% 75%, 0% 25%); /* Defines the hexagonal shape */
    overflow: hidden; /* Hides any content that exceeds the hexagonal shape */
    transition: border-color 0.3s ease; /* Smoothly transitions the border color when hovered */
}
```

## 4. Hover Effects for Hexagon

The following styles are applied when hovering over the hexagon:

```css
.hexagon:hover {
    border-color: #6b46c1; /* Changes the border color to a purple shade when hovered */
    animation: pulse 1.5s infinite; /* Initiates a pulsing animation that continues while hovered */
}
```

## 5. Pulse Animation Keyframes

The following keyframes define the pulsing animation for the hexagon:

```css
@keyframes pulse {
    0% {
        border-color: #6b46c1; /* Starting color */
        transform: scale(1); /* Starting scale */
    }
    50% {
        border-color: #b794f4; /* Midpoint color */
        transform: scale(1.05); /* Scale up */
    }
    100% {
        border-color: #6b46c1; /* End color */
        transform: scale(1); /* Scale back */
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Keyframes

- **0%**: Initial state with starting border color and scale.
- **50%**: Midpoint of the animation, changing the border color and increasing scale.
- **100%**: Final state returns to the original border color and scale.
